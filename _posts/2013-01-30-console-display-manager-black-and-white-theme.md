title: "Console Display Manager: Black & White Theme"
---
I created this theme for CDM a while ago to match the virtual terminal’s
appearance. I have been using it ever since and decided it’s time to share this
with the world. My contribution has been accepted in the code base.

> CDM is a minimalistic, feature-complete, console display manager. It
> starts the session of your choice, whether that is a terminal or an X 
> session, can fire up multiple sessions per user and lock them in a 
> specific tty. For people that like consoles.
