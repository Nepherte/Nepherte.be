title: TotalDAC D1-Dual
---

So here's the deal. I don't like talking about my own hi-fi gear. Being the
actual owner of the system and having invested a significant amount of money in
it, I am inherently biased about its performance. Despite numerous requests, I
have been able to hold off making any comment whatsoever on headphones,
amplifiers or digital-to-analog converters. That all changes today. I was so
taken aback by the lack of reviews on the TotalDAC d1-dual that I decided to
write one of my own. So without further ado, here it goes.

# Specifications

The TotalDAC is a non-oversampling, digital-to analog converter, developed by
Vincent Brient, the eponymous founder of the French company. It has a discrete R2R ladder
design, consisting of 200 high-quality vishay foil resistors per channel. That
makes for a total of 400 resistors altogether. Inside, there’s a 69-bit field
programmable gate array (FPGA), responsible for the outstanding digital volume
control, DSD to PCM conversion (optional) and 2-way active crossover (optional).

The TotalDAC outputs a solid 3.1 Vrms unbalanced and an impressive 6.2 Vrms
balanced. With the volume maxed out, these voltages might reduce the usable
range for your amplifier’s volume control. An alternative is to lower the
volume on the DAC, giving the amplifier more room to play with. But hey, don’t
gaze at the specifications, the sound is what matters. And we’ll get to that in
a bit.

**Brief summary**

- Class A discrete transistor output stage
- Non-oversampling, with compensation filter
- Embedded custom clock with anti-jitter FIFO memory buffer
- R2R ladder using 0.01% Vishay Foil Resistors, 200 resistors per channel
- Digital inputs: Asynchronous USB, optical, RCA and AES-EBU
- Analog outputs: RCA, XLR  and 1/4” headphone jack
- Output voltages (Vrms): 3.1 for RCA and 6.2 for XLR
- Bit rates (Khz): 44.1, 48, 88.2, 96, 176.4 and 192

The included remote allows you to select the input (RCA/AES-EBU/Optical/USB),
volume (up/down), phase polarity (inverted/normal), earth connection (on/off)
and the digital treble filter (on/off). The settings can be saved to memory and
are not lost when powered off. Did I mention you can automatically turn off the
display? Really helps with the light pollution when listening in dark
environments.

**Remote control**

- Display (on/off)
- Earth connection (on/off)
- Volume adjustment (up/down)
- Phase polarity (inverted/normal)
- Digital treble filter (on/off)
- Input selection (RCA/AES-EBU/Optical/USB)

# Packaging

Some people did complain about the way the TotalDAC is packaged for shipment.
I can only assume Vincent has changed his shipping methodology since then,
'cause I received mine carefully stored in a double box with crazy amounts
of bubble wrap. In fact, there was so much bubble wrap involved that
environmentalists would definitely object. The actual pieces are wrapped in
a thin foil to prevent any scratching. Sure, gold embroiled gift paper wrap
is not part of the deal. That is really not something to be disappointed about.

**What's in the box?**

- 1x D1-Dual
- 1x Power Supply
- 1x Power Cord
- 1x Remote Control
- 2x AAA Batteries
- 1x USB Cable (2m)

<br/>
Note that the TotalDAC USB cable is optional (€390) and not included by
default. It comes highly recommend for everyone using a computer as source.
Apart from the cable, I also opted for DSD (€350), which is implemented as
DoP inside the FPGA. I had a small window of opportunity to test DSD during
a Belgian mini-meet. The first thing that came to mind: "But this is what
vinyl sounds like!" The total price, as configured, is €10640. Shipment with
FedEx is another €140, although that varies from destination to destination.

The USB driver can be downloaded from [http://www.totaldac.com](http://www.totaldac.com).
A link is sent to you by email upon purchase. The company website also provides
usage instructions for the remote control. I somehow expected a printed manual
inside the box, but found nothing of the sorts. Seems like a small effort to
include this. While maybe obsolete, I’m an “RTFM” kind of guy. Overall, the
packaging is outstanding.

# Build Quality

The build quality of the TotalDAC is superb. It looks and feels very solid, with
no buttons to speak of besides the switch on the back of the power supply. The
included remote is the only way to change the settings. The design is borderline
minimalistic and sleek, with a funky trapezoid face plate available in black or
silver. A welcome alternative to the many cuboid-shaped housings you can find
today.

TotalDAC uses the same housing for all of its products. That means unused inputs
& outputs, covered up and nicely tucked away in the back. Definitely not worth
obsessing over. After installation, you will likely forget they were even there
to begin with.

The remote is a bit of a let-down. I understand the reasoning to go with a
sturdy Philips remote. It gets the job done. But let's be honest, for the money
you might as well include a fancy remote. And while I only used the remote
during initial setup, people that actively use the volume control or switch
between inputs, use it all the time. The devil is in the details.

{% include image.html src="/_images/totaldac-d1-dual-remote.jpg" %}

The housing, and the face plate in particular, has a tendency to attract dust.
People try to handle their equipment with care. Keeping it dust-free is one of
those things. I only wished Vincent would include a dust cover in the total
package. That really goes a long way.

# Sound Quality

Now let’s cut to the chase. The million dollar question, or in this case the
€10640 question, is whether the DAC is really worth all that money? I found that
it is not all that black & white. People often buy expensive products with the
wrong expectations. If you expect to be blown away by the very first note, then
the answer is no. If you take the time to listen to all the micro-details, then
absolutely!

For this review, I used the Sennheiser HD800 connected to the balanced out of
my Cavalli Audio Liquid Gold. The TotalDAC is in turn driven by Roon running on
my computer using the optional USB cable. The entire system is balanced, from
end-to-end.

The first thing I noticed is that the TotalDAC really pairs well with my
Sennheiser HD800. Most people would agree that the HD800 are on the bright
side, some would even go on and say they are overly bright. Not me though, I
really enjoy my HD800s and can listen to them for hours without any signs of
fatigue. However, I did find the headphone sounded slightly less bright when
paired with the TotalDAC. I'd think it has something to do with the
non-oversampling aspect. I am definitely no audio guru so I might be wrong.

I heard a significant difference in the higher end harmonics. While listening to
a recording of “Nightingale” by Norah Jones, the guitar plucks just sound way
more realistic. It’s not the actual chords that improve, but the way each pluck
resonates afterwards. I find that only few DACs are capable of reproducing
these resonations, and the TotalDAC is definitely one of them.

Another area in which the TotalDAC really shines are the drums, and cymbals in
particular. In my opinion, very few DACs get the high-hats right. In Placebo’s
Speak in Tongues, there’s one of them in the background that I simply do not
hear on my Primare NP30. Even at low volumes, the TotalDAC clearly separates
this instrument from the others. And once you know it’s there, it really makes a
difference.

Many a song is simply great because of its dynamics. Sometimes it’s subtle,
sometimes it’s not. Sometimes it’s loudness, sometimes it’s rhythm. But a DAC
that gets the dynamics right, gets an advantage in my playbook. Songs that have
these traits are Foo Fighter’s “New Way Home” and “Every Street” by Dire Straits.
The TotalDAC has no difficulty keeping up with either one of these songs.

One of my all-time favorite songs has, and always will be “Jeremy” by Pearl Jam.
Whenever I listen to the chorus, Eddie’s vocals overwhelm me. It gets me
every time. Same story with the TotalDAC. To be honest, I could not discern
any  difference with my Primare NP30, but it’s always good to know the goose
bumps are still there. The reason I mention this is to stress that it is really
important to audition any piece of equipment with the music you truly like.
It doesn’t matter if it’s a €100, a €1000 or a €10000 DAC. For all I care, the
song could be a 128 Kbps mp3. If it doesn’t sound good on a DAC, simply walk
away. And to me, this is one of those songs.

Overall, I would say that this DAC sounds quite natural and it definitely has
a wonderful musicality to it. There’s a good separation of instruments, with
a tight and controlled bass. The high frequencies are a bit rolled off. The
dynamics and detail retrieval are better than anything I’ve heard. The
sound is definitely an improvement over my Primare. At 4 times the cost,
that is something I would expect.

# Customer Support

I made several inquiries to Vincent over email. He answered all of them to my
satisfaction in less than a business day. He also provides a 14-day trial
period to customers during which they can evaluate the product at home with
their own gear. If not satisfied, they are entitled to a full refund, minus
the shipping costs. I honestly doubt even a single customer returned any of
the items back to sender.

I negotiated an extended trial period due to the fact that I often, and
unpredictably, have to travel abroad for work, which significantly reduces
my time to audition gear. Vincent gracefully agreed to my terms. In retrospect,
that was uncalled for. It truly is a keeper.

Each product is built upon request. Imagine my surprise when all of a sudden, 3
weeks after ordering, it shows up on my doorstep. It was almost too good to be
true, considering Vincent was prepping up for the Munich 2015 High-End Show next
week. His courier of choice is FedEx, and safe to say, a good choice indeed. 3
days after the initial shipping announcement, I signed off for delivery.

# Conclusion

I’m really enjoying this DAC. If we add up the superb build quality to its
distinguished sound signature, this DAC has everything to make it to the top.
There’s a few things I’d like to see improved. Most of them are related to the
accessories, the remote control for one. That would have been the frosting on
the cake. I encourage everyone to go have a listen.

I haven’t had the opportunity to compare it with other DACs in
the same price range. I did hear the Schiit Audio Yggdrassil and found it to
come up short compared to the TotalDAC. You won't hear me say X is better than
Y though. For comparisons with the likes of Bricasti M1 or MSB Analog, I
refer to other sources. I would be very interested in other people’s takes on
this piece of equipment.
