# Introduction

It's that time of the year. The holidays are just around the corner and in
the true spirit of Christmas, I decided to get myself a brand new computer.
With sadness in my heart, I depart from the workstation that got me through
5 years of University. It is only now that I realize that Microsoft has never
gotten a hold of the little bugger. It looks like Arch Linux has served me well
throughout the years. That is quite an accomplishment. But let us not dwell on
what Operating System you should, or should not, use. Way to philosophical for
this post.

# System Specifications

I choose components based on four criteria: silence > performance > reliability
> linux compatibility. The first determines the case, cooler and fans. The second
means using an Intel CPU. The third dictates a workstation motherboard and
quality PSU. The fourth ultimately boils down to an Nvidia GPU. Taking these
constraints into account, I got the following list of components:

- **Case**: Fractal Design R5
- **Fans**: 3x Noctua AF-14 PWM fans
- **PSU**: Seasonic Platinum 660W
- **MB**: Asus Z-97 WS
- **CPU**: Intel i7 4970
- **Cooler**: Noctua U12S
- **RAM**: Kingston HyperX Fury 2x8GB
- **SSD**: Samsung 850 Pro 256 GB
- **Graphics**: Asus 970GTX STRIX
- **Optical Drive**: Asus BC-12D2HT

# Building Experiences

To build or not to build? Instead of ordering a computer from the likes of
Dell or Hewlett-Packet, I figured a true engineer simply assembles his own.
With nothing but a screw driver and the basic building blocks, I relived my
childhood years wasted on Lego.

After hours of reading manuals - yes, some people do read them - I puzzled all
the pieces together right in time for dinner. I held my breath. Would it boot
or would it explode in my face? After powering up, lights started blinking.
That's always a good sign. As it turns out, I did get most of it right from
the beginning. A complete check-up revealed that I did not correctly wire the
front audio connectors. Who needs those when you have a dedicated hi-fi system
right? Other than that, no malfunction of any sorts. A job well done.

# Finished Workstation

I was pleased to hear that the system is dead-silent. No whining of the sorts.
Got a little worried that the graphics card would make too much noise. Turns out
that at normal duty the fan does not spin at all. What I really liked is that
you can now configure the fan speeds in the UEFI. Using Arch Linux, I was rather
annoyed that until now everything was managed at OS level. Set the fans to run
steady and strong at 500 PWM to keep things cool. To wrap things up, here's a
picture of the finished workstation:
